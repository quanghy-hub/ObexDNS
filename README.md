## 📖 Introduction

**Obex DNS** is a lightweight, scalable, and privacy-focused DNS resolution system. It runs entirely on Cloudflare's edge network, leveraging the ultra-fast response of Workers and the efficient storage of D1 database to provide users with a granular DNS control experience.

### What is DNS over HTTPS (DoH)?

DoH (RFC 8484) is a protocol for performing DNS queries via encrypted HTTPS connections. Compared to traditional plaintext DNS, DoH can:
*   **Prevent Hijacking**: Prevents ISPs or third parties from tampering with DNS responses.
*   **Enhance Privacy**: Hides your browsing history through an encrypted tunnel.
*   **Bypass Censorship**: Provides more stable resolution in restricted network environments.

## ✨ Core Features

-   🚀 **Ultra-fast Resolution**: Fully based on edge computing with extremely low global latency.
-   **Multi-profile Management**: Supports creating multiple independent configurations, each with a unique endpoint.
-   🛡️ **Granular Filtering**:
    -   **Allow/Block Lists**: Supports exact domain and subdomain wildcard matching.
    -   **Third-party Rule Sets**: Supports subscribing to external blocklists in formats like AdGuard.
    -   **Custom Redirection**: Supports custom overrides for A, AAAA, TXT, and CNAME records.
-   📊 **Real-time Stats & Logs**: Visual dashboard recording every request's hit reason, geo-location, and upstream latency.
-   🔐 **Privacy Enhancement**: Flexible ECS (EDNS Client Subnet) configuration (Forward, Custom, or Hidden).
-   🌗 **Modern UI**: Dark mode support, high-density management panel built with React + BlueprintJS.

### Resolution Pipeline
When a DNS request arrives, it goes through the following processing stages:
1.  **Memory Cache Check**: Checks if a valid response for the query exists in the edge node's memory.
2.  **Config Loading**: Layers profile settings loading from Memory -> Cache API -> D1 Database.
3.  **Local Rule Matching**:
    -   **Whitelist**: If hit, forwards directly to upstream and returns.
    -   **Redirection**: If hit, returns custom records.
    -   **Blacklist**: If hit, returns NXDOMAIN.
4.  **External List Filtering**:
    -   Uses **Bloom Filter** for rapid initial screening.
    -   Combines with **Cache API** to cache verdict results, reducing database pressure.
5.  **Upstream Resolution**: If none of the above hit, requests the upstream DoH server based on configuration, with optional ECS support.
6.  **Async Logging & Caching**: Asynchronously records resolution logs, fetches target GeoIP, and writes results to various cache levels.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Development Environment
-   **Node.js**: v18.x or later
-   **Package Manager**: npm
-   **Cloudflare Account**: Workers and D1 permissions required

### Local Development
1.  Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2.  Initialize D1 Database:

```bash
npm run db:setup
npm run db:migrate
```

3.  Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4.  Deploy online

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Online Deployment (Cloudflare Dashboard)
1.  **Fork this repo**: Click the `Fork` button at the top right to clone the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create D1 Database**: Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard, go to `Workers & Pages` > `D1`, and create a new database (e.g., named `obex_db`), and copy the created database ID.
3.  **Configure Database ID**: In your forked repository, edit the `wrangler.toml` file and replace `database_id` with the ID of the database you just created.
4.  **Create Worker**: Go to Cloudflare dashboard `Workers & Pages` > `Create application` > `Create Worker`.
5.  **Import from GitHub**: On the deployment page, select `Deploy from GitHub`, connect your forked project, and complete the authorized deployment.
